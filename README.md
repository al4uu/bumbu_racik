## üßÇ ‚ö†Ô∏è Bumbu Racik has been discontinued.
This module is *discontinued* since [**SnapFest**](https://github.com/al4uu/snapfest.git), its *successor*, is here way more stable, faster, and optimized. But the **repo‚Äôs** still up, so if anyone wants to **fork** and keep it going **unofficially**, they still can.
